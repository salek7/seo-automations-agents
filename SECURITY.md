## Vulnerability Reporting

Thank you for your interest in the security of Nodes Hub Automations! We take security very seriously and encourage responsible vulnerability reporting.

### How to report a vulnerability?

If you found a security vulnerability, **DO NOT** create a public issue on GitHub. Instead:

1. **Send an email** to: [security@example.com]
2. **Use subject**: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability in Nodes Hub Automations`
3. **Describe in detail** the vulnerability in the email body

### What should you include in the report?

- **Vulnerability description** - what exactly was found
- **Reproduction steps** - how to reproduce the problem
- **Potential impact** - what the consequences could be
- **Suggested solution** - if you have an idea how to fix it
- **Contact information** - how we can contact you

### What happens after reporting?

1. **Confirmation** - you will receive confirmation within 48 hours
2. **Analysis** - we will analyze the report within 7 days
3. **Updates** - you will be informed about progress
4. **Resolution** - we will publish a security fix
5. **Acknowledgments** - we will add you to the contributors list (if you want)

## API Security

### API Keys:
- **Never** place API keys in code
- Use environment variables
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor API usage

### Connections:

- Log validation errors

### Output data:
- Do not log sensitive data
- Implement access control
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Regularly clean old data

## Security Updates

### Update process:
1. **Detection** - vulnerability identification
2. **Analysis** - impact and risk assessment
3. **Development** - creating a fix
4. **Testing** - fix verification
5. **Deployment** - update publication
6. **Communication** - informing the community

### Versioning:
- We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
