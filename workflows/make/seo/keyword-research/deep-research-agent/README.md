# ðŸ¤– Deep Research Agent

## Automation Description

The automation works like a ChatGPT Deep Research agent - it independently conducts multi-step research on the internet for complex tasks. It accomplishes in tens of minutes what would take a human many hours. Ideal for intensive knowledge work in areas like finance, science, policy, and engineering.

## How it works?

1. **Retrieves research query** from Google Sheets
2. **Independently plans strategy** for multi-step research
3. **Conducts iterative searches** on the internet
4. **Analyzes hundreds of sources** online (texts, images, PDFs)
5. **Synthesizes knowledge** from various sources
6. **Generates comprehensive report** at research analyst level
7. **Documents all sources** with citations and reasoning summary

## What is Deep Research?

Deep Research is an advanced agent that:
- **Independently discovers** information on the internet
- **Reasons** about found data
- **Consolidates insights** from various sources
- **Creates new knowledge** through information synthesis
- **Documents the process** with citations and reasoning

## Requirements

### APIs and Tools
- Google Sheets API
- [SerpData.io](https://serpdata.io/) API for search
- Web Scraping API for content retrieval
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o or o3) for analysis and synthesis
- PDF Processing API for document analysis
- Image Analysis API for image analysis

### Input Data Structure
Google Sheets should contain columns:
- `research_query` - research query
- `research_depth` - research depth (1-5)
- `domain` - domain (finance, science, policy, etc.)
- `output_format` - report format (PDF, Google Docs, etc.)

## Deep Research Process

### Phase 1: Strategy Planning
1. **Query analysis** and goal setting
2. **Planning research steps**
3. **Identifying key sources** to check
4. **Establishing criteria** for information evaluation

### Phase 2: Iterative Search
1. **Initial searches** in Google
2. **Analysis of first results** and gap identification
3. **Additional searches** based on found information
4. **Verification** and cross-reference of information

### Phase 3: Analysis and Synthesis
1. **Processing hundreds of sources** (texts, images, PDFs)
2. **Semantic analysis** and extraction of key insights
3. **Knowledge synthesis** from various perspectives
4. **Creating new insights** through information combination

### Phase 4: Report Generation
1. **Structuring** found information
2. **Creating comprehensive report** with citations
3. **Documenting the reasoning process**
4. **Verification** and validation of conclusions

## Configuration

1. **Prepare research queries** in Google Sheets
2. **Configure API connections** (SerpData.io, OpenAI, Web Scraping)
3. **Set research parameters** (depth, domain)
4. **Configure output format** for reports

## Results

The automation generates:
- **Comprehensive research report** at analyst level
- **Complete documentation** with citations and sources
- **Process summary** with reasoning
- **Data visualizations** and analyses
- **Recommendations** and strategic conclusions

### Report Structure
- **Executive Summary** - key conclusions
- **Methodology** - research process description
- **Main findings** - most important discoveries
- **Source analysis** - credibility assessment
- **Strategic conclusions** - recommendations
- **Bibliography** - full citations

### Output Columns
- `research_query` - original query
- `research_summary` - research summary
- `key_findings` - key discoveries
- `sources_analyzed` - number of analyzed sources
- `research_duration` - research duration
- `confidence_score` - confidence assessment of conclusions
- `report_url` - link to full report
- `research_depth` - research depth
- `completed_at` - completion date

## Usage

1. **Add research query** to Google Sheets
2. **Set research parameters** (depth, domain)
3. **Run the automation**
4. **Wait 5-30 minutes** for research completion
5. **Analyze comprehensive report** with citations

## Benefits

### For professionals
- **Time savings** - hours of work in minutes
- **Comprehensive research** at analyst level
- **Documentation** with citations and sources
- **Verifiable** and reliable results

### For companies
- **Competitive analysis** in real-time
- **Market research** and trends
- **Strategic reports** for business decisions
- **Automation** of intensive research work

### For scientists and researchers
- **Literature review** in specialized fields
- **Knowledge synthesis** from various sources
- **Discovery** of niche information
- **Creating new knowledge** through synthesis

## Differences vs traditional search

### Traditional search
- Single queries
- Limited source analysis
- No information synthesis
- No process documentation

### Deep Research Agent
- Multi-step iterative research
- Analysis of hundreds of sources
- Synthesis and creation of new knowledge
- Complete documentation with citations
